# anim

I started messing around with DPaintIV recently and making
animations, in order to do the illustrations for this essay:

And I decided to see if I could get CSS to create simple repeating
animations using DOM elements.

I hacked for a couple hours and landed here. I'm putting it up on
GitHub because I'm trying to get stuff off my hard drive and into
the world.

It's nowhere near done--it doesn't save your work or anything.

But it's kind of neat and I would like to return to it, or work it
into some products.

## What should it be?

The thing I'd like is to be able to define simple looping animations
for short chunks of HTML. The place that's most attractive for this,
for me, is headlines, pull-quotes, stuff like that--HTML could be a
carnival and instead everyone is aping prints. Headlines that do
things and throb a little or sing or dance could make for a more
joyful Internet.

So that's where I'll take this, maybe: As a little headline-making
tool that lets you create a headline style that will be a little
exciting. Some font choices, etc.
